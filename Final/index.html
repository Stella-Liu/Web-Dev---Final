				<p>There was a Little Frog who lived at the bottom of a deep, dark well.<br><br>
 				It was a very old well filled with shallow water at the bottom.The walls of the well were covered with wet moss.<br><br>
 				When the Little Frog was thirsty, he drank a little bit of the well water,and when he was hungry, he ate some insects.When he was tired, he lay on a little rock at the bottom of the well and looked up at the sky above him.<br><br>
 				He was very happy and satisfied.</p>

				<p>The Little Frog has been living in the old well since he was born.He had never been to the outside world.<br><br>
 				Birds would fly by and stop at the edge of the well and the Little Frog would always look up and say 
 				<br><br>"Hello! Why don't you come down here and play with me. It's so pleasant down here. 
 				I have cool water to drink and countless insects to eat. At night, I can watch the twinkling stars, and sometimes I can see the beatuiful moon too."

				<p id="p1" onclick="nextPar()">One day, a yellow sparrow stopped by at the edge of the well.
				<br><br>"Hello, Mr. Yellow Sparrow. How are you? Please come down to my most beautiful house."
				The yellow sparrow didn't say a word and flew away.
				The next day, the sparrow came again and the same thing happened.
				It went on for <em>six</em> days.
				On the seventh day, the yellow sparrow said,
				<br><br>"Little Frog, may I show you the outside world?"
				But the Little Frog refused the offer.
				The Yellow Sparrow became angry and flew down to the bottom of the well.

				<p id="p2" onclick="next()">The birds would then tell the Little Frog 
				<br><br>"Hi, Little Frog! The outside world is much bigger and nicer. It's many times more beautiful than your little well at the bottom."
 				The Little Frog didn't believe them.
 				<br><br>"Don't lie to me, I don't believe there is any place better than here."
 				Gradually, all the birds began to dislike him.
 				They thought he was too stubborn and stopped talking to him.
 				The Little Frog couldn't understand why nobody would like to come down to his nice place.</p>

 				"That river and sea, how much water do they have? How much bigger are they than my well?"<br><br>
 				The Little Frog began to realize how tiny his well was.
 				"Let's go down, okay?"
